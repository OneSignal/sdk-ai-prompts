# OneSignal SDK AI Prompts

AI-powered SDK integration for your mobile and web apps.

## Quick Start

Select your platform to get the AI integration prompt:

| Platform | Languages | Link |
|----------|-----------|------|
| Android | Kotlin, Java | [Get Prompt](integrate.html?platform=android) |
| iOS | Swift, Objective-C | [Get Prompt](integrate.html?platform=ios) |
| Flutter | Dart | [Get Prompt](integrate.html?platform=flutter) |
| Unity | C# | [Get Prompt](integrate.html?platform=unity) |
| React Native | JavaScript, TypeScript | [Get Prompt](integrate.html?platform=react-native) |

## How It Works

1. **Select your platform** from the table above
2. **Copy the AI prompt** that appears
3. **Paste into your AI-enabled IDE** (Cursor, GitHub Copilot Chat, etc.)
4. **Answer a few questions** (App ID, language preference)
5. **Let the AI integrate** the OneSignal SDK
6. **Review the PR** with all changes ready to merge

## What the AI Does

When you use these prompts, the AI will:

- Create a new branch (`onesignal-integration`)
- Add the correct SDK version for your platform
- Follow your existing architecture (MVVM, MVC, etc.)
- Create a centralized OneSignal manager class
- Handle threading correctly (off main thread)
- Add unit tests for the integration
- Create a Pull Request with all changes
- Output a PR summary for you to copy

## Demo Mode

If you don't have a OneSignal App ID:

1. When asked for your App ID, say "use demo"
2. The AI will create a **Welcome View** with email and phone input
3. On submit, it triggers a welcome journey (email + SMS)
